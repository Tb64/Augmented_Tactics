(you are being trained to become part of the brotherhood, you survive the attack with a high ranking member. You help him
rebuild and he betrays you, rifts are openly accepted)
Opening Scene-
Setting: (family_home1)(unknown time)
	Background:The brotherhood exists only to police both the real and rift worlds. They ensure that the magic of the 
rift world doesn't corrupt the real world. And they make sure that the technology of the real world doesn't corrupt 
the rift world. It is widely known that the universe will collapse if either the former or the latter occur. A war is about
to erupt between the brotherhood and a faction that wishes to cause the collapse because they believe true enlightenment
will result from the unification of magic and technology. The faction has gained enough power to defeat the brotherhood
and attacks the land that produces all of the weapons first to disarm them.

	(Tutorial Begins) You're following the commands of your master and the battle between the brotherhood members and
the faction begins. They have the advantage and kill most of your men, but when only 2 of you are left, the cutscene begins
and the other brotherhood members have assembled to stop the threat. The faction runs away.

Basic Idea: You continue to be taught by your master throughout the game and rebuilding of the brotherhood. Every battle is
with the faction at different points as they work towards their end goals. Your master appoints you as a full fledged
member just before he tells you that he is the leader of the faction and suddenly much of his tutledge has hinted as much.
You can choose to join him for the climactic battle or stay with the brotherhood.
IDEA1: Whichever side wins the battle is the ending of the story
IDEA2: If the player solves that the master is a traitor the player has a chance to kill him before he reveals his 
intentions, so the final battle would become easier.
