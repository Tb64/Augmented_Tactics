Thanks for purchasing this pakage, I hope you are going to have as much fun building your interiors, as I had compiling this package.

Please could you rate and possible review the package, it really assist others in making informed purchases
when spending there hard earned money :) 

Mobile & Desktop:
The textures sheets has intuative atlas textures usage with a huge amount of prefabs reading of each textures sheet.
The groupig was done if such a way that say all the wooden furniture can be used with another project a with eaze.
This will assit with lowered draw calls aspecially when using Static Batching or MeshCombine functions.

Also, all the screenshots and DEMOS that you have seen has been achieved with a Diffuse map only,
so no funnies that a mobile device might not be able to display.

The scenes that was used for the screenshots are all inside the Demo Scenes directory.


The particle effect are easy to use drag & drop prefabs.

Send some screenshots to info@3dforge.co.za of your work and I will showcase them on the website

Grid system:
The tiles/walls/floors have been done with a 2,5 x 2,5 x 3 units grid size.

ProGrids Settings:
if just building scenes that sis on one level, 2,5 is good
If building Multi-Level scenes us 0,5 so that the height snapping also works out. 

Doors:
The door items have been exported with the Y Axis being the rotational axis.
Make sure, the "Pivot" selection next to Global is active

Trapdoors:
The trapdoor items have been exported with the X Axis being the rotational axis.
Make sure, the "Pivot" selection next to Global is active

Roofs:
I used the floor prefabs, just grab the whole bunch, rotate and vertice-snap them into place.


Enjoy
