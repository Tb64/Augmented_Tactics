Lord Commander Doogy: "To what end Lord Decet? To what end did you imagine you’d carry on with this folly?"
Lord Frederick Decet: "To the end of kingship my Lord. A dream deterred."
You: "Deterred or deferred?"
Frederick Decet: There is a powerful army which can disappear and reappear at will, now isn’t the time for bickering.
We stand together or we no longer stand."
You: "As if we could just forg-"
Doogy: "Quite right my Lord, now is the time to join forces and resources.
We should fall back to the End and begin fortifying immediately."
You: "And leave the remaining houses in the dark?
The Brevaries and the Malas should be warned!"
Frederick Decet: "There’s no time for such nonsense. We must think of our survival first.
My men and I will retreat with the brotherhood and-"
Grandfather: "Listen to the young ones for once lord deceit."
Frederick Decet: "That’s Decet to-"
Grandfather: "It’s garbage as far as I’m concerned. You fools seem to have forgotten how the rifts were stopped in the first place.
We need the powerful mages of the Graveyard if we hope to stop them again. 
We could have used the power at the end, but it appears they’ve pulled a strategic move and killed off all of the veterans who could have ended this quickly."
Doogy: "Now we need the power brought only by the rifts? What a concept."
Grandfather: "How dare you condescend to your elder? Who do you think you are masked stranger?"
Doogy: "Someone who knows you much better than you think he does?"
You: "This is pointless. Will the Brevarys help us? They haven’t always been the most welcoming house."
Grandfather: "Times are changing, we need them as much as they need-"
Frederick Decet: "This is preposterous! Why should we take the advice of a withered old man?"
Lord Jhovan Rifiuti: "A withered old man who survived your pathetic excuse of a surprise attack long enough for me to arrive."
Doogy: "Let’s not exchange insults Lord Rifiuti, I maintain that the end must be fortified."
You: "And I maintain that we must inform the other houses and gain the support of the Brevarys, so what shall we do Lord Commander?"
Doogy: "Both. Each house will provide men to return to the End and fortify it;
while the rest of you will press onward through the Twin Snakes to the Graveyard."
You: "Will you not be joining us Lord Commander? Who will represent the End in these negotiations?"
Doogy: "And leave you alone to be rift bait? Of course not!
I will accompany you to the Graveyard;
and you who have proven yourself superior in both battle and diplomacy will represent us in these negotiations… Lord Commander."
