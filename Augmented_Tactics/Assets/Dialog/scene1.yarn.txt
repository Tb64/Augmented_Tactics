“Go on son, the realm won’t protect itself from all the mages, warlocks and grumpkins. You’d better get riding”, your father jests as you say your final goodbyes.

"Seems you’ve forgotten that The Great Divide is an ancient battle ground where our ancestors destroyed the Great Rift and severed the connection between our world and the rift world. And all of that iron you’re so proud of is a product of those battles and that war.”
