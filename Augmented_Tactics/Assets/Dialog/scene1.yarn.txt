Lord Abaddon Auspi: "Go on son, the realm won’t protect itself from all the mages, warlocks and grumpkins.
You’d better get riding..."
Grandfather: "Now now, you leave the brave lad alone.
You’re doing the realm a great service boy, and don’t let anyone tell you different.
Least of all this lot of ironmongers."
Abaddon Auspi: "We are the Auspis of The Great Divide son, we are more than glorified sentries, yet you’ve forgott-"
Grandfather: "And how is it, my foolish son, that we became the lords of The Great Divide?
Seems you’ve forgotten that The Great Divide is an ancient battle ground where our ancestors closed the Great Rift and severed the connection between our world and the rift world.
And all of that iron you’re so proud of is a product of those battles and that war."
Abaddon Auspi: "And now that war is over, the battle won and the rifts forgotten. All that remains is the Auspi legacy."
Grandfather: "The rifts have not been forgotten, not by me. I’ve seen them..."
Abaddon Auspi: "Let’s not begin with your delusions again old man. A rift hasn’t been seen in over 200 years!"
You: "I believe you grandfather, and I will uphold the other side of the Auspi legacy as I see fit father.
Now if you both are done bickering, I should be off."
