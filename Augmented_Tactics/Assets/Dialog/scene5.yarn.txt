Jhovan Rifiuti: "He was a great man. I'm so sorry."
John Causion: "As am I my lord. A shame he had to die for the future to be born." 
You: "All great men should be kings… That's what he always used to tell me.
And when I said we don't have a king, he said that's because only great men should be kings."
Doogy: "My father used to tell me the same exact thing. Back before he hid me away at the End that is."
You: "Who was your father? Is he still alive?"
Doogy: "Aye he is for now. But that's a story for another time.
How will you avenge your family is what you should concern yourself with."
You: "Vengeance is futile, they control the rifts. We submit to their rule.
I have no interest in a crown. As I once believed my father didn’t."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "There must be something we can do. Your father, your brother, all that we've lost will be for nothing if we submit."
You: "And what if we don't? We continue to fight and die until we no longer exist?"
Doogy: "The rifts are not all powerful, neither are the rift walkers.
Our ancestors defeated them once and history may repeat."
You: "Our ancestors? So you are of the Great Divide?" 
Doogy: "That's not important… What is important is that the rifts were stopped long ago using a power that the End has kept sacred.
Without our veterans, we can't use it, but there are those who still can in the-"
King Decet: "And what are you fools conspiring? Are you planning my coronation banquet?"
Rifiuti: "The only meal I have for you is the edge of my sword… Your Grace."
Decet: My my you wound me. Is that any way to speak to your new kingd-"
You: "You have your kingdom. There is little need to postulate. Allow us time in peace to grieve if you would."
Decet: "Well since you asked so nicely…"
Mystery Person: "A question, asked one was not. A demand, made one was. Blatantly if not subtly."
Decet: "I’m so very sorry sir I don’t understand your Daghobic accent."
Lord Adonai Brevary: "Lord should you say. Sir I am not. Enki of house Brevary."
Decet: "And what is a Lord in the presence of a King? A subject.
Speaking of which, I believe it is time your house bent the knee to your new King Eery of the west."
Adonai Brevary: "Knees, unbent remain. Heads, unbowed remain. Resolutions, unbroken remain.
Reasons to unaltered remain abundant are. Reasons to rule submit, absent are."
Frederick Decet: "Do not test the patience of your kings. In fractions of a second my numbers rise from one to thousands." 
You: "I would advise you to take heed Lord Brevary. Our new kings are allied with the rift walkers.
Through them they control the rifts."
Adonai Brevary: "Rifts. Rift walkers. Tools, powerful in hand, useless when taken.
Advantages, how they change with time.
Life, how it abruptly ends."

Adonai Brevary: "Ah the main event, to this we are skipping. Time, to be saved. Victory, to be ensured."
Frederick Decet: "I am commanding you under the authority of the King in the East and the King in the West to bend your knee and swear fealty, or be slaughtered."
You: "Seriously has that line worked at all in this game?"
Frederick Decet: "What?!"



You: "Do you plan to kill us all my Lord? Or do to us whatever you seem to be doing to the rift walkers?"
Adonai Brevary: "Death, to you was not promised. A king, you wish not to be.
All of you, survive will do. Homage, all that required is."
Doogy: "How many different kings is that now? I’m noticing a pattern I’m not very fond of."
You: 'Thankfully you left me in charge of the diplomacy. We will acc-"
Jhovan Rifiuti: "And what of the rift walkers? What of those you’ve seemed to have enslaved?
Will they be returned to their homes or shall we live as savages once again?"
Adonai Brevary: "Walkers, treasonous subjects are. Punishment, many forms will take.
Advancement, bits of knowledge to gain."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "I’ll not live in a world built on torture and slavery, not even behind an Auspi."
You & Doogy in unison: "You Don’t have to."
You: "We will live or die, Together and free…"
Doogy: "For we are the end."
John Causion: "Perhaps you are, but not I. House causion stands behind King Brevary."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "You would truly fight to have us all live as slaves?"
John Causion: "I would truly fight to have us all live. Lord Auspi made the correct decision bending the knee earlier.
If there is one thing I have learned in my old age it is this. In war, always bet on the victor."
Doogy: "And yet in your feverish attempt to survive, you’ve all but ensured your death my Lord.
We may lose the battle but will never lose this war."
Adoinai Brevary: "Minds, concluded are. Calamity, soon and often to ensue is.
An end, quickly we must arrive at. If you, to dissuade I have failed, then I to death all of you do sentence!"
