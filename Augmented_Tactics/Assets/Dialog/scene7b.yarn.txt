You: "So what, uncle, is the part that I missed?"
Uncle James Auspi: "I thought it was always Doogy?"
You: "Minds change with the weather, uncle Doogy."
James Auspi: "There was another reason that I fled.
I was like you, I had no interest in rule as a child, but your grandfather always insisted that I play my role.
That role included being crowned after I brought the experiments to an end.
I refused; and your grandfather gave me a choice.
The brotherhood or death.
I was soon masked and installed in the realm as a recruit. I’ve lived in exile ever since."
You: "But my father was always the same. He told me…"
James Auspi: "He told you exactly what my father used to tell us.
Somehow in his old age, he got the idea that the Auspi destiny was to become kings, and he somehow corrupted your father with these ideas.
Perhaps he just didn’t want to be another outcast. It doesn’t matter now.
All that matters is that monarchy is a nuisance we shall never suffer again."
You: "Hopefully not."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "There is no need for hope; for we have made it a reality."
Jason Malas: "But what of the other Brevarys and the rift walkers? They’ve begun to regain their consciousness."
You: "We will pardon the repentant and imprison the obstinate.
Let us now establish a link with the rift walkers and establish a counsel; that this travesty may not repeat itself in the future.
Let us reopen the rift and disband the brotherhood."
James Auspi: "An honorable move, however, you have just robbed me of my home nephew."
You: "And invited you into yours uncle. Let us go home."
James Auspi: "As you command... Lord Auspi."
