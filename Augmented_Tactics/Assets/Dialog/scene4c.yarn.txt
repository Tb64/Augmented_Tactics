Lord Shtephend Eery: "So much of your father isn’t in you, and yet here your stand in his same position with the same choice.

Jhovan Rifiuti: "Don’t listen to him, he’s lost twice as many men as we have. We can hold them."
You: "To what end Lord Rifiuti? To be kings of barren wastelands and cold empty taverns?

If they’d like to rule so badly, let them. And let the rest of us live in peace."
Frederick Decet: "You are wise beyond your years young Lord.
