You: "What of the women, children and non-combatants?"
Doogy: "We’ve sent word to all of our subjects. They’re being hidden away under secret coves near the end."
Lord Enlil Decet: "Will none of them join us in battle? The time is not for warriors but all able bodies."
Doogy: "This battlefield is no place for women; and the children are not old enough to hold a knife, let alone a sword."
Enlil Decet: "Careful my Lord, one day your proclamations may trigger someone."
Doogy: "Trigger some…?"
You: "And how long will we have to prepare before they discover our plot?"
Jhovan Rifiuti: "A fortnight, if that. They have the power to appear wherever they see fit.
The time limit may be a matter of luck."
You: "We will work with what we have. I understand the Malas have the power to control rifts, but what does that mean exactly?
Should we be weary?"
Doogy: "Lord Jason Malas has always been something of a friend to the brotherhood. We have shared and shared alike.
They have the power to open and close the rifts as they see fit. They also can predict where a rift is soon to appear.
They do not, to my knowledge, possess the power of necromancy."
You: "To bring the dead to life… a treacherous power indeed."
Doogy: "Indeed, to be made to fight one’s own blood is unforgivable. I will show no mercy."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "Curious, you seem the most afflicted by the battle at the Graveyard and yet, you are the only combatant who faced none of your kin."
You: "Not true… A brother would constitute kin; would it not uncle?"
Jhovan Rifiuti: "… It can’t be!"
Doogy: "How long have you known?"
You: "Since just now, but I’ve suspected for a while. It explains why your face is always covered.
Why the secrecy? And why have I never met you?"
Jhovan Rifiuti: "Because your uncle is dead… He died long before you were born. Or so I was told."
Doogy: "Not dead, only hidden.
And the secrecy was to avoid this conversation, and to guide you down this treacherous path."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "Hidden… Hidden so well and so quickly that you couldn’t inform your closest friend?"
Doogy: …
You: "I’m assuming you two have met?"
Jhovan Rifiuti: "May I introduce your uncle James Auspi.
Former truest and oldest friend to yours truly, original heir to the Auspi legacy; and a true pile of cow dung!"
Doogy: "There will be time for bickering and explanations later. All that matters now is-"
You: "Get Ready Everyone."
Lord Jason Malas: "Welcome my Lords!
I hope you’ve enjoyed your stay at Castle Wildfire, please be sure to toss a favor into the Fire Lake for good fortune on your way out."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "A true friend to the brotherhood we’ve found. Such a warm welcome."
Doogy: "Jason you old fool, let us in."
Jason Malas: "And what is this? A dead man who speaks?
Absolutely singular! And why pray tell, should I let any of you inside of my gates?
Why should I not alert the new self proclaimed king of the world of this treason?"
You: 'Because if flame truly never dies here, then the flame of our alliance bred 200 years ago should still burn brightly.
Recall a time when the Malas and Auspi were all but destroyed by the rift Walker army; and only through working together survived.
I shan’t forget it. And any Malas will always be welcome in my hearth."
Jason Malas: "Ah a wordsmith among you. Strong with understanding at that!
Answer this question correctly and I shall aid you all in any way possible. Who is the true king of the world?"
You: "......
Justice…"


Jason Malas: "So it is decided. 
We will await the appearance of King Brevary and immediately close the rift behind him.
His army will no longer be able to follow him through and we will deal with him here."
You: "And we will deal with the politics after."
Enlil Decet: "I disagree.
If we’re to fight together: I must know, will you take revenge on my house for your late father when the war is won?"
You: "May this fight be my last.. I hold no grudge in my heart."
Doogy: "That sounds similar to something I said just before I was exiled…"
Jhovan Rifiuti: "Exiled? How and why? End the cryptic speech and give me a direct answer!"
Doogy: "Very well, around the celebration of reaching my 20th year...-"
Jason Malas: "My Lords, they are here..."
