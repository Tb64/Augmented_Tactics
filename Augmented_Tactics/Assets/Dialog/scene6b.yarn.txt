You: "We will close the rift behind him; he will have no means to escape or summon more soldiers.
Was this not the proclamation made Lord Malas?"
Jason Malas: "Time and unforeseen occurrence befall us all my Lord. How do we proceed is the true question."
Doogy: "We’ve missed our chance. The next time he appears he’ll summon his entire force at one time and crush us."
You: "Not necessarily… He does know we can close his rifts, but what he does not know may still harm him."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "What are you plotting my Lord?"
You: "We close all but one rift, the Great Rift at the End.
We battle them there where this all ended centuries ago.
With history and the battlefield on our side we would win the day."
Doogy: "Perhaps that was true before our powers were destroyed by the initial attack.
We hold little to no advantage at the End now."
Enlil Decet: "My lords I ask you. Why must we fight at all?
We can simply close all of the rifts and the realm may prosper peacefully again."
Jason Malas: "Would that we could my Lord. With his magic, the king could undo what we have done.
It will only take a great deal of time and they would return."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "It appears we’ve been stranded in the desert with no provisions my Lords."
You: "Perhaps. Lord Malas, what would result from a simultaneous opening and closing of a rift?"
Jason Malas: "The rift would open. The portal would just be less powerful and close soon after it opened.
Summoning would take much longer, as the king would have to reopen the rift."
You: "And therein lies our strategy.
Lord Malas, we shall spread your mages around the major areas of the realm and have them close all areas to new rift spawning.
When the king attacks the End, we will shut the Great Rift as he opens it.
He will be able to summon a large army, but only in small increments. The mission is clear."
Doogy: "Destroy the king before he has a chance to spawn too much of his army or overcome our rift magic.
An ingenious plan, nephew."
You: "I know no uncle until he explains himself.
And even thereafter you shall be Doogy to me. In jest of course."
Doogy: "As you wish. Now if you wouldn’t mind my Lord, shall we save the realm?"
