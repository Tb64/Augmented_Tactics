You: "Is that the last of them?"
Doogy: "Looks that way brother."
You: "But I haven’t even gone through training yet..."
Doogy: "You’re an Auspi of The Great Divide and you somehow survived that battle.
I’d say your training is complete."
You: "The veterans won’t like that."
Doogy: "I would think your father would have taught you not to mind the opinions of the dead."
You: *looks around and sees that all veterans including the Lord Commander are dead*
"Alright, how do we proceed... Lord Commander?"
Doogy: "This place is a mess. We need to establish a base. We can rebuild it, we have the technology…
Send word to lord Jhovan Rifiuti to meet us at The Great Divide. We’ll need to raise an army."

You:"...and that’s what his name really means in a foreign language."
Doogy: "And he’s thought not to change it after all of these years?"
You: "Reverence has replaced humor, and the true meaning is all but forgotten."
Doogy: "To each his own I suppose. Had I been born into that line I would have immediately changed my name when I became lord."
You: "With a name like Doogy and a mask like yours I doubt it.
Pray tell, what is your true name? To what house do you belong?"
Doogy: "Questions for later. I think I see Lord Rifiuti."
You: "How? It should have taken much longer to travel from the Frost Swamp."
Doogy: "Well if you’d just look at your castle it would be rather obvious."
You: "Oh right. Sorry I didn’t think I’d be home again for years."
Doogy: "You still might not be…"

*Looking out, you witness that The Great Divide is under siege*
