You: "Why a kingship? Why a change at all?"
Lord John Causion: "You’re asking the wrong Lord, ‘twas the captured Lord who conceived this plot."
Frederick Decet: "Yes lord Eery, the brains to my thoughtless bron."
You: "Really I would like to know what the cause of all of this is.
If the rift walkers win, all of our problems are ended.
However, if we survive, we’ll have to solve this problem."
Decet: "Oh and how often the cause of the problem wants to solve the problem.
The truth is I would rather fight for my own sovereignty than bend the knee to another’s."
You: "Crypticism becomes you my Lord. Would you care to elaborate?"
Frederick Decet: "Did your late father tell you nothing? I suppose he wouldn’t.
You weren’t his intended heir. No matter, hear this now.
Since the beginning of your Lord father’s reign as Lord of the Great Divide, he’s slowly spread his influence into other lands.
Levying taxes on subjects he had been given no sovereignty over and enforcing his laws in our lands.
All attempts to exile his influence from our land have been met with severe resistance and even threats.
We decided to do what we must for the sake of our kingdoms and rid the world of the Auspi infestation."
Doogy: "You will withdraw these accusations. I will not have the Auspi name defamed in my hearing!"
John Causion: "Such a surprise that an outsider would care about the name of a great house. Things must be different in the Great Divide.
However, Lord Decet speaks truths and half truths alike. Isn’t that right Lord Rifiuti?"
Jhovan Rifiuti: …

You: "Is it true that my father had turned conqueror?"
Jhovan Rifiuti: "Yes my Lord, it is as Lord Decet says. But half truths are the exact way to describe his soliloquy.
Lord Decet neglects to mention that citizens and peasants had been disappearing from the Grove and the Woodlands.
I sent 100 men to investigate, 10 returned. They sang songs of kidnapping, violent torturing, and attempts to awaken dark powers.
The occupation was an attempt to silently eliminate these experiments."
Frederick Decet: "Any experiments outside of your lands are none of your concern. You should have stayed safe in your land.
Now matters are much worse thanks to you and your righteous face.
What fortune though, that through this chaos we will at least seen the end of your house and your tyranny."
You: "I don’t plan on going anywhere, but-"
Frederick Decet: "Strange, neither did your father…"




You: "We don’t have time for this my Lords!"




Frederick Decet: "There is nothing but this my poor fool Lord Commander.
And what has been kept from my family for years shall never be taken again.
To arms men!"
