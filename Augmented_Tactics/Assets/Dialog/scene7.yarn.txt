Enlil Decet: "If this plan of yours fails, you’ve just led an entire armada to the last of our citizens."
Doogy: "Even if we should lose the day, the peasants will be safe.
The entrance and pathways to the underground catacombs are a brotherhood secret."
Jason Malas: "What a comfort! Should we die, at least the peasants can be slaves. 
Or die of course."
You: "Our minds should only be on strategy and victory at this point."
Doogy: "There will be time enough for that later.
You’ve all asked and not been answered.
The true reason behind my exile and secrecy...
Around the completion of my 19th year, there was a plot to take over the realm.
The Eerys and the Brevarys were caught attempting to open the rifts and tame the powers within.
The brotherhood and Auspis attempted to covertly end it.
I was one of the heads of the campaign."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "And this is when you disappeared for months; the year before you faked your death?"
Doogy: "Yes. And shortly after we shut the operation down, we found that they had already been successful in importing multiple warriors posing as citizens and workers.
Among these were some hand maidens, including the one I fell in love with…"
You: "So you met in secret, got found out, and were given a choice, watch her die or live in exile.
So you hid her away and joined the brotherhood under a different name and started wearing a mask.
You also hid her in the catacombs so you could visit her. Have I missed anything or may we move on?"
Doogy: "Actually that is most of the truth. The important part you missed is that…-"
Jason Malas: "My Lords... the time is now!"
