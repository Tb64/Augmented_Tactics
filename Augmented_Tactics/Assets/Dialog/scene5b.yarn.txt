You: "What a bargain! We have traded two crazed kings for one crazed king."
Doogy: "No, we’ve traded submission for freedom. I am proud of this bargain."
You: "Again I ask you to what end? We’ve no way to stop them from opening a rift right now and attacking with their true force."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "That is not entirely true. They can go wherever they want t’is true.
However, they can only open rifts in known areas and they don’t know where we are."
Doogy: "Precisely, and they also don’t know what we know."
You: "And what do we know?"
Doogy: "We know that we have the greatest advantage in our territory.
The Fire Swamp is an area that was never conquered by the original rift walker army.
We also know that the Malas family holds a secret which will all but eliminate the rift advantage."
You: "What exactly do you mean?"
Doogy: "I suppose you were still a novice when this all began.
We of the brotherhood have always guarded the secrets of rift opening and closing.
Unfortunately this knowledge was lost when our archives were destroyed and wise veterans murdered.
Thankfully though, the secret was also entrusted to another remote land of the east. One we’ve all ignored until now."
You: "The Malas…"
Doogy: "If we can gain access to this power, we will eliminate their rift advantage.
The de facto king Brevary will still have control over the rift walkers and a large force, but he will no longer be able to easily mobilize them or continuously call on his soldiers."
Jhovan Rifiuti: "These terms are more than acceptable..."
