Lord John Causion: “Now there’s a proper jest. Never has a name been so properly assigned to a house.
One I before E and everyone can see just what you are” *laughs*
Lord Frederick Decet: “And what of you Lord Causion? You’ve stood sentry between two rivers your entire life.
Never to reap the fruit of success, never to know the taste of victory.”
John Causion: “The only fruit you’ll reap is a right kick in the arse when lord Auspi hears of your plans.
Or have you forgotten that he has the gold to hire every soldier in the Frost Swamp?”
Frederick Decet: “By the time Lord Auspi catches wind of our plans, he will face a siege at his gate and no way to reach the Frost Swamp to raise an army.
Lord Rifiuti will bend the knee to our new kingdom once he gets word that the Auspis have returned to the dirt.”
John Causion: “And what of the Brotherhood and their armies? Do you suppose his kin will sit meekly and watch their brothers be slaughtered?
And there is the small problem of their.. Other powers”
Frederick Decet: “And here I had thought you were a man of wisdom, such a disappointment...”
John Causion: “It must have been quite a long foray through the Graveyard. Yet you still don’t believe in the old powers?”
Frederick Decet: “I trust only what my senses report my Lord, as should you.”
John Causion: “Very well then, walk you and your armies down the plank. Have courage in chaos” *snickers*
Frederick Decet: “Stand faithful and firm between your rivers until the bitter end my Lord” *sarcastically*
