(more of a cliche. Evil comes from rifts, you fight back against it. choice to parlay rather than fight in the end)
Opening Scene-
Setting: (capital city)(day of discovery)
	Background: You're second in command of the kingsguard/kingsmen. The rift world has somehow merged with the real
world and people who wield magic have invaded and wreaked havoc. (Player has choice of which kind of character he wants to
be and can learn the magic of the invaders) The battle begins.

(tutorial begins) You are following the lord commander into battle. If you chose magic, you simply learn to counter thier
magic. The battle is a losing one and soon only you and a few members are left. Soon, the cavalry arrives and drives away
the forces of the invaders back into the rift. Novices are now needed to train and prepare for the wars to come.

Basic Idea: You are promoted to lord commander and are charged with recreating the kingsguard/kingsmen. You encounter the
army of rifters throughout your journey and the final battle is between you and the head mage. 
IDEA1: You have the chance to parlay and diminish the forces of the magic world, or get them more angry at you and increase
their forces.
IDEA2: The last battle can be a trial by 4 eliminating the war aspect.
