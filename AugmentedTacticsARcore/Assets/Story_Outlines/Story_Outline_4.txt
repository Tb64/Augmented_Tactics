Opening Scene-
setting: (land1)(street of steel)(first day of discovery)
	Background: You are the commander of the kingsmen/kingsguard and you are the first to notice one a rift opening
above the capital city. You watch as an overwhelming force invades the kingdom and makes its way towards the castle. They
wish to unite the magic world and real world. The king is convinced they simply want to invade and conquer.  

(tutorial begins)You command all of your men in battle but you are handly defeated. Almost everyone but your apprentice 
and you survive. You both vow to rebuild the brotherhood together. The king is taken hostage.

Basic Idea: As you train your apprentice and new members you begin to groom your apprentice for leadership. As more rifts
are discovered, more battles occur and more people are brought into the cause. Parlays occur between the invaders and the
brotherhood.The brotherhood ends up splitting between those who support the expansion of the rifts and those who want 
destroy the invaders. Your apprentice goes to whichever side you don't go to. 
IDEA: If you choose to side with the invaders, you automatically kill the king. Your choice creates a completely different
ending.
